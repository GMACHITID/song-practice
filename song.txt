WAKING FROM THE GRAVE
BODIES STIFF AND COLD
SCRATCH THE COFFIN'S DOOR 
TEAR THE ROTTEN WOOD

DEAD BENEATH THE GROUND
DEMENTED VOICES CALL 
BREAKING THROUGH THE DIRT
FOREVER ROAM THE EARTH

ALL I FEEL IS PAIN
MENTALLY DERANGED
HANKERING FOR BLOOD
HUNGRY FOR THEIR BRAINS

TEARING OFF THEIR LIMBS
DEVOUR MEAT FROM BONE
FEELING MORE ALIVE THAN 
I EVER DID BEFORE
